# EasyShopping

An online store web app developed using Java and Spring as part of a group programming project during my Bachelor degree. 

## Docker
To run app locally execute build-and-run.sh script:

```bash
./build-and-run.sh
```

This will run mongo container, build the app and run it with tomcat. The app should be available at: 
```
localhost:8080/EasyShopping
```
